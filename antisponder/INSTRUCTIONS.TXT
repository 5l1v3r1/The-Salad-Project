antisponder.salad  -d "log flood" -t 2

This program seeks out and disrupts or destroys Man in The Middle (MiTM)
attacks based on fraudelent responses to broadcast name queries. Attackers
with hosts that respond to all broadcast LLMNR or NBNS name queries will are 
detectable. This program sends out queries for randomly named hosts and
assumes that all hosts that respond are performing MiTM attacks. It attaches
to their HTTP(S) services and either floods them or sends fraudelent queries.

Command Line Examples:

antisponder.salad -d "log flood" -t 2 -i eth0
	-d   "log" the attack and "flood" the attacker with fake hashes
	-t   repeat the detection methodology every 2 seconds
	-i   use the "eth0" network interface

antisponder.salad -d "hash" -u usernames.txt -p 20 
	-d   send a username/password combination from a text file
	-u   text file with usernames and possibly passwords
	-p   repeat the detection methodology at random time interfals that average out to 20 seconds
	


Username/Password File Format:
	Each entry should be delimeted with a '\n'.
	Passwords are optional, if you want to include them, use a space or tab 	to separate the username and password. This works for the user "gthomas" 	with the password "liberator123":
	gthomas liberator123
	
	If you want the computer to make up really difficult passwords, just
	leave out the commas and the passwords.
