Welcome to The Salad Project



These tools are designed to demonstrate technologies for the enhancement of
Intrustion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPSes). Simplicity was also an 
across the board design goal, hopefully demonstrating that network security
does not need to involve high price "magic boxes."

The name "Salad" comes from "Seek-Locate-Destroy", which is the title of an 
episode of the groundbreaking space opera television show Blakes 7. 
In this episode, several characters engage in a plot to break encryption
by stealing a cryptograghy machine.



The current tool set includes:


Shove

	A MiTM utility that sniffs for pre-defined TCP segments and inserts
	scripted responses into the data stream
Ewok

	A MiTM utility that targets Powershell Empire by repackaging "stage 2" 
	payloads.

Pesky

	A utility that frustrates WPA2 Pre-Shared Key (PSK) recovery attacks
	by spoofing false handshakes with arbitrary PSKs

Sol

	Detection and eventual frustration of "karma" attacks	

Antisponder
	
	Detection and frustration of LLMNR/NBNS response spoofing MiTM attacks
